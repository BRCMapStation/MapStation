FIRST STEPS!

Start by double-clicking the MapTemplate scene in the Map Template folder. The BRC Map Creator object, which should be at the top of the scene hierarchy, holds the menu that will be responsible for building your map when it's done.

Try to build the existing template map using that menu- then load the resulting map file into the MapLoader plugin by placing it in the Bepinex/Plugins/jasonofthestorm-BRC_MapLoader/Maps folder.

Now you can start your own map by duplicating the Map Template folder and renaming the necessary items to your own map name, or creating your own folder and scene containing the necessary objects.

Drag and drop the prefabs from the map folder into the 3D view to start setting up interactive gameplay elements. All of the prefabs other than the GrindPrefab can simply be moved, rotated, and scaled. Grind prefab in particular still needs a lot of work to get all of its functionality in one place.

Use the BRC Map Creator object to rename and build your map when it is ready.
