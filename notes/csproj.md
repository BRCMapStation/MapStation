This doc describes modifications which are automatically applied to copies of the `.csproj` files generated by Unity.

You don't need to do this manually.

See `CodeEditorIntegration.cs`

## Problem

Get VSCode intellisense for `MapStation.Tools`

### Wrinkles

Must have `MapStation.Tools` `csproj`s in root `MapStation.sln`, else it doesn't do intellisense.

BepInEx's `<PackageReference Include="UnityEngine.Modules"` does not reference Editor APIs nor packages such as `EditorCoroutines`. Unity's auto-generated `csproj`s reference these correctly.

Cannot use Unity's generated `MapStation.Editor.sln` b/c:

- wrong root directory, excludes `MapStation.Common` and `MapStation.Tools`
- excludes Plugin code

## Solution

Set Unity's script editor to VSCode.

Clone auto-generated `MapStation.Tools` and `MapStation.Tools.Editor` w/`-alternative` suffix

Modify them:

- `<TargetFramework>netstandard2.1` -> `<TargetFramework>net471`
- `<NoWarn>0169;USG0001</NoWarn>` -> `<NoWarn>0169;USG0001;CS0649;CS0169</NoWarn>` (optional, convenience)
- Adjust references to MapStation.Common and MapStation.Tools:
  - `<ProjectReference Include="../MapStation.Common/MapStation.Common.csproj" />`
  - `<ProjectReference Include="MapStation.Tools-alternative.csproj" />`

Add both `-alternative` csprojs to `MapStation.sln`
