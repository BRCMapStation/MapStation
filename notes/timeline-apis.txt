@cspotcode's notes about Unity's timeline and animation-related APIs

---

Monobehaviours implementing ITimeControl can also be driven by a Control track

optionally implement ITimelineClipAsset to specify Clip's capabilities

[TrackBindingType(typeof(MyComponent), TrackBindingFlags.AllowCreateComponent)]
[TrackClipType(typeof(MyPlayableAsset))]

IPlayable implemented by all Playables

ScriptPlayable: IPlayable that wraps a PlayableBehaviour

Signal or Marker
- point in time, no duration

analysis paralysis:

Implement a custom type of track:
- Appear playabledirector
- idle playabledirector
- disappearplayabledirector

During initial fast-forward of the timeline, skip appear and disappear

Activation tracks activate trigger volumes that detect the player
When triggered, the tree timeline refuses to advance
This can be used to prevent the tree from growing while the player is inside regions that will be changing.
- But allow player on other parts of the tree!

GOTCHAS
First step after a jump does not deltaTime, it evaluates the jumped-to time
OnBehaviourPause is called when the timeline starts, *before* the clip has been hit!
If timeline needs to rewind, nuclear option: reset from start
- do this if SlopCrew *ever* gives us a negative delta
